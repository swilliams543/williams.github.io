For this look I have paired a long, sleeveless colorful vest with dress pants. I paired it with a black cami. You can also pair this with a silky top as well. Since the color is bright, I paired this suit with brown, pointed toe sandals. This is a great look for work or an event. You are sure to have your own individually if you opt for this unique, chic look. For my hair, I wore a red bob which complements the color green. Whether you are going to work or going to an event, you're such to be unique with this summer, inspired look!
